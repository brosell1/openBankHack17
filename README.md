# openBankHack17

Team School of Code's entry for the Railsbank Open Bank Hack 2017. Over the course of one weekend, we used React and Express to develop a business banking app using Railsbank's comprehensive API. We aimed to make a white-label product that could easily be rebranded and we implemented four-eyes verification for added security.

At the end of the hackathon, we were given the award for Best Team.
